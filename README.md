Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Nasa API and weather API!

An application that allows the user to receive information about the location and weather at NASA facilities all across the united states!

Using two APIs, both with very dense return objects, provided a significant challenge during the development of this application.
Both of these APIs were designed for engineering and science purposes so they each included a tremendous amount of data.

the bulk of development was spent figuring out how to gracefully pick apart each object, find the relevant data, and ultimately 
render and display that data as elegantly as possible for the user.

In the end I included a feature to allow the user to decide how many query results to see as to avoid being overwhelmed with the result
